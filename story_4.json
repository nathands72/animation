Using his small size and sharp teeth, he gnaws through the net ropes while the birds guide him. Together, they work as a team - the birds using their wings to lift parts of the net and Moti using his quick paws to untangle the knots. They successfully free all the birds, and everyone celebrates their friendship and teamwork.",
